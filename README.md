# LLM-JEPA for Feynman Squared Amplitudes
### Description
One of the most important physical quantities in particle physics is the cross section, or a probability that a particular process takes place in the interaction of elementary particles. Its measure provides a testable link between theory and experiment. It is obtained theoretically mainly by calculating the squared amplitude. This project will explore language model joint embedding predictive architectures for calculation of squared amplitudes.
Computing squared amplitudes of feynman diagrams from amplitudes is an O(N^2) problem in high energy physics. To reduce the complexity of the problem solving, we instead attempt to map a amplitudes to a simplified form of squared amplitudes, dramatically decreasing the computation time.

**Prerequisite Test:**

This repository evaluates Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) and tokenization strategies for mapping high-energy physics amplitudes to their squared amplitudes (A → |A|^2). We experiment structural representations (Infix vs. Prefix notation) and evaluates the impact of physics-informed augmentations.

To evaluate locally, download to the `logs/` directory and run `inference/evaluate.py` using the `--wt_path` argument.


## Data Pipeline & Tokenization

Provided dataset was limited for training a good transformer. To resolve this, I exploited Feynman diagram Permutation Symmetry. By extracting and locking kinematic variables (s_12, m_e, p_3), I applied seeded random shuffles to generic indices (`%gam_115` → `%gam_002`). I yielded a 15x dataset expansion without breaking physical topologies. A strict 80/10/10 split is enforced before augmentation to guarantee zero data leakage.

Standard BPE tokenizers shatter physics tensors into meaningless fragments. I implemented a regex lexer inspired by previous work to process entire kinematic tensors including subscripts and superscripts as single tokens:
`r'[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*(?:_{[^}]+})?(?:\([^)]+\))?(?:_[a-zA-Z0-9_]+)?(?:\^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+)?'`

Raw strings undergo a standardization pass before tokenization:
* `**` → `^`
* `^(*)` → `^CONJ` (prevents token shattering)
* `INT_NEG` → `NEG ` (forces operator behavior)
* `s_12` → `MANDELSTAM_12` (prevents alias collapse)

The tokens are then processed through a Shunting-Yard algorithm. This acts as a dynamic toggle, allowing the pipeline to output either standard Infix or tree-based Polish Prefix ASTs to compare learning efficiency.



## Architecture & Training

The model is a Decoder-Only causal language model utilizing PyTorch's `nn.TransformerEncoder` with a strictly causal `torch.triu` mask, avoiding the cross-attention overhead of standard seq2seq setups.

Following the official LLM-JEPA implementation, the model executes two forward passes:
1. Generative pass using a standard causal mask where the target auto-regressively attends to the prompt.
2. JEPA pass using a 3D blocked mask where the target is strictly blinded from the source prompt.

The objective function minimizes:

$$\mathcal{L} = \text{CrossEntropy}(Y, \hat{Y}) + \lambda_{\text{jepa}} \left(1 - \text{CosineSimilarity}(h_{\text{text}}, h_{\text{code}})\right)$$

During validation, standard teacher-forcing accuracy naturally misaligns and grades structural boundary tokens (`[SEP]`, `[EOS]`). To fix this, shifted logits are dynamically sliced (`seq_preds = preds[:, t_size : t_size + c_size - 2]`) to strictly evaluate mathematical tokens.

The training script retains full dictionary states (`model_state_dict`, `optimizer`, `scheduler`, `epoch`) to seamlessly resume Cosine Annealing without learning rate decay resets.


## Inference & Multi-Tier Evaluation

Standard repetition penalties suppress valid operators that naturally recur in squared amplitudes. This was fixed by isolating the penalty strictly to `input_ids[prompt_len:]`, penalizing only the generated latent tree and not the prompt.

Because symbolic math can be written in multiple valid ways, token-level accuracy is insufficient. I evaluate generation using four metrics:
1. Exact Sequence Match
2. Token Accuracy (positional alignment)
3. Structural Match (Levenshtein edit distance)
4. Algebraic Match (`sympy.simplify(pred - gt) == 0`)

Evaluating Prefix models with SymPy requires a custom stack-based `prefix_to_infix` parser before ingestion. This solver is wrapped in a 2-second `signal.alarm` to kill infinite CPU hangs caused by invalid generated topologies.
